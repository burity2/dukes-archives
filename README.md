Project made in during the Full Stack JavaScript Course, by The Odin's Project.
Main goal:
- learn JS Classes and Constructors 
- Apply form input and input processing on a page

Personal Note:
Out of everything I’ve done so far, this was one of the most fun. Really had to spend some brain juice figuruing out how to properly delete through their id. I liked the styling process and writing Thoth's comments as you interact with the page.
